# Data science Portfolio Project Repository
## PROJECT 1 : [Sales-Forecasting](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/forecasting-of-sales-data.ipynb)
Linear regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM models are used to forecast total sales for each store. During model evaluation, however, the XGBoost model beats the linear regression and LightGBM models with a higher MSLE value. As a result, the XGBoost model = 0.02 MSLE. is utilised to forecast sales in the test data.
## PROJECT 2 : [customer-churn-and-prevention-in-travel-industry](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/customer-churn-and-prevention-in-travel-industry.ipynb)
predict customer churn based on machine learning Classification using
the Random Forest algorithm and SVM XGboost finded log loss for models and compared. Churn and survival times using survival analysis dataset exploration. Accuracy: 86%
## PROJECT 3 : [customer-segmentation](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/customer-segmentation.ipynb)
Aim to segement the Customers based on RFM so that the company can target its customers efficiently.K-Means Clustering with 3 Cluster Ids and Hierarchical Clustering with 3 Cluster Labels.plots the results,used linkages.Elbow Curve to get the right number of Clusters.
