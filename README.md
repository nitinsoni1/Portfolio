# Data science Portfolio Project Repository
## PROJECT 1 : [Sales-Forecasting](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/forecasting-of-sales-data.ipynb)
Linear regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM models are used to forecast total sales for each store. During model evaluation, however, the XGBoost model beats the linear regression and LightGBM models with a higher MSLE value. As a result, the XGBoost model = 0.02 MSLE. is utilised to forecast sales in the test data.
## PROJECT 2 : [Customer-Churn-and-Prevention-in-Travel-Industry](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/customer-churn-and-prevention-in-travel-industry.ipynb)
predict customer churn based on machine learning Classification using
the Random Forest algorithm and SVM XGboost finded log loss for models and compared. Churn and survival times using survival analysis dataset exploration. Accuracy: 86%
## PROJECT 3 : [Customer-Segmentation](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/customer-segmentation.ipynb)
Aim to segement the Customers based on RFM so that the company can target its customers efficiently.K-Means Clustering with 3 Cluster Ids and Hierarchical Clustering with 3 Cluster Labels.plots the results,used linkages.Elbow Curve to get the right number of Clusters.
## PROJECT 4 : [Predict-Gold-Price](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/predict-gold-price.ipynb)
Linear regression is used to forecast gold prices. This model was developed using a daily gold price data from Yahoo Finance. Linear regression has been utilised, along with other data wrangling and data visualisation approaches, and the accuracy has been predicted using the r-squared method. The moving average notion of data wrangling is also emphasised in this strategy.
## PROJECT 5 : [Sentiment-Analysis-of-Text-Data-NLP](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/NLP%20Projects/%20nlp-project.ipynb)
Sentiment Analysis and Prediction of Review Ratings on the Yelp Reviews Dataset using Natural Language Processing Project, EDA Using Text Processing AND MultinomialNB. predict product score based on the comments provided for that product.
## PROJECT 6 : [Banknote-Authentication-using Tensorflow](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Deep%20Learning/banknote-authentication-tensorflow.ipynb)
In this dataset we have data of original and Fake Bank notes. We will try to build a Machine learning model which will help us to classify notes as Authentic [1] or Fake [0] . In this notebooke we will cover following things.Learning Vector Quantization.Accuracy = 0.98
## PROJECT 7 : [Instagram-Clone](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20Projects/instagram_clone.sql)
Created the database and its table in MY SQL. Analyze data usingAggregate Functions. Run complex queries using MySQL logical operators and string functions Design and implement complex database schemas. Used SQL Joins and extracted information.
## PROJECT 8 : [Olympic-Games-Analysis](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/olympic-games-analysis.ipynb)
Data analysis of countries for summer and winter olympics Find out the most sucessful countries and their factors.Importing Numpy Pandas Seaborn and Matplotlib, Data cleaning and formatting. Merging and concatenateing data frame and Plotting the results.
## PROJECT 9 : [Global-World-Terrorism-Analysis](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Power-BI%20Projects/Global_World_Terrorism_Analysis.pdf)
The major issue I'll be attempting to address with this Data Exploration is how relevant this concept and the information associated with it are to the data we have.
And perhaps, in the end, I'll try to match the definition to the data.With POWER-BI Dashbord.
## PROJECT 10 : [Kick-Starter-Sales-Dashboard](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Power-BI%20Projects/Sales_Dashboard.pdf)
Analyzing Company's Sales data. Created and used DAX measures for powerful insights. Build a sales dashboard page in POWER-BI. Publishing and sharing the dashboard with the audience. Updating data and refreshing reports.
