# Data science Portfolio Project Repository
## PROJECT 1 : [Sales-Forecasting](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/forecasting-of-sales-data.ipynb)
Linear regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM models are used to forecast total sales for each store. During model evaluation, however, the XGBoost model beats the linear regression and LightGBM models with a higher MSLE value. As a result, the XGBoost model is utilised to forecast sales in the test data.
## PROJECT 2 :[customer-churn-and-prevention-in-travel-industry](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/customer-churn-and-prevention-in-travel-industry.ipynb)
predict customer churn based on machine learning Classification using
the Random Forest algorithm and SVM XGboost. Churn and survival times using survival analysis dataset exploration. Accuracy: 86%
