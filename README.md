# Data science Portfolio Project Repository
## PROJECT 1 : [Sales-Forecasting](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/forecasting-of-sales-data.ipynb)
Linear regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM models are used to forecast total sales for each store. During model evaluation, however, the XGBoost model beats the linear regression and LightGBM models with a higher MSLE value. As a result, the XGBoost model = 0.02 MSLE. is utilised to forecast sales in the test data.
## PROJECT 2 : [customer-churn-and-prevention-in-travel-industry](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/customer-churn-and-prevention-in-travel-industry.ipynb)
predict customer churn based on machine learning Classification using
the Random Forest algorithm and SVM XGboost finded log loss for models and compared. Churn and survival times using survival analysis dataset exploration. Accuracy: 86%
## PROJECT 3 : [customer-segmentation](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/customer-segmentation.ipynb)
Aim to segement the Customers based on RFM so that the company can target its customers efficiently.K-Means Clustering with 3 Cluster Ids and Hierarchical Clustering with 3 Cluster Labels.plots the results,used linkages.Elbow Curve to get the right number of Clusters.
## PROJECT 4 : [predict-gold-price](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Projects/predict-gold-price.ipynb)
Linear regression is used to forecast gold prices. This model was developed using a daily gold price data from Yahoo Finance. Linear regression has been utilised, along with other data wrangling and data visualisation approaches, and the accuracy has been predicted using the r-squared method. The moving average notion of data wrangling is also emphasised in this strategy.
## PROJECT 5 : [Sentiment-Analysis-of-Text-Data-NLP](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/NLP%20Projects/%20nlp-project.ipynb)
Sentiment Analysis and Prediction of Review Ratings on the Yelp Reviews Dataset using Natural Language Processing Project, EDA Using Text Processing AND MultinomialNB. predict product score based on the comments provided for that product.
## PROJECT 6 : [Banknote-authentication-using tensorflow](https://github.com/nitinsoni1/Portfolio/blob/main/Deep%20Learning/banknote-authentication-tensorflow.ipynb)
In this dataset we have data of original and Fake Bank notes. We will try to build a Machine learning model which will help us to classify notes as Authentic [1] or Fake [0] . In this notebooke we will cover following things.Learning Vector Quantization.Accuracy = 0.98
